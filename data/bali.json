This is the time when the risk of getting scammed is at its peak. Beware of overly friendly locals who offer you \u201ca great holiday deal\u201d - timeshare scam is popular. Money exchange is another concern - do it in certified places only - you can count your changed money several times, but you\u2019re still likely to walk out with at least 10% of it missing (the trick is a very special cashier table with a crack in it)","id":8,"place_id":6,"updated_at":"2012-12-02T05:19:32Z"},{"badge":3,"created_at":"2012-12-02T05:25:43Z","desc":"This is the time when water around the South is very clear - perfect for snorkeling and diving. Get out of the mainland and visit one of the smallest islands South of Kuta (e.g. Lembongan) or islands around Lombok and you will enjoy the best of what the underwater world can offer. In comparison to many advertised snorkeling spots in Thailand, the reef around Bali is still very alive.","id":9,"place_id":6,"updated_at":"2012-12-02T05:25:43Z"}]}
