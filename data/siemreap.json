Siem Reap usually gets waist level water, especially by its canal. If you stay out of your hotel/hostel - you\u2019re going to get really wet, staying inside however doesn\u2019t really guarantee being dry since most buildings are going to be flooded too. Siem Reap\u2019s canal is commonly used for damping trash in it, so expect all that trash to float around during floods.  Roads will be flooded as well, so traveling in and out of Siem Reap will be complicated.",
